"""Patch the Crystal source so the *compiler* can be built for wasm32-wasi.

    python3 apply-patches.py <crystal-src-root>

Two of the compiler's commands cannot exist in a wasm build:

  * `crystal play` starts an HTTP server -- it needs sockets, which WASI
    preview 1 does not have. Crystal already gates this behind
    `flag?(:without_playground)`, and the command dispatcher honours it, so
    playground needs no patch -- only `-Dwithout_playground` at compile time.

  * `crystal docs` pulls the `markd` shard (a binding to the md4c C library),
    which is not available and not wanted. There is no existing flag, so this
    adds one in the same style: skip the two files and make the dispatcher
    report the build has no docs support.

Each edit is an idempotent literal replacement; the script refuses to continue if
a target does not contain the expected text, so a Crystal version bump fails
loudly instead of silently skipping a fix.

Idempotency note: several patches only *insert* text, so their replacement
contains the original verbatim (`new ⊇ old`). For those, `new in text` is not a
usable "already applied" signal -- the old text survives inside the new one and
the patch would apply again on every run. They carry an explicit `marker`: a
string that appears only in the patched file. Patches whose new text cannot be a
substring of the old one need no marker.
