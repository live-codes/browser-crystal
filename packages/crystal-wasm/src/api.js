	 * acted on -- and `onStatus` has something to say while a 22 MB payload loads.
	 *
	 * A compiler holds the compiled assets (a 35 MB module among them), so a caller
	 * that has finished with one should `dispose()` it rather than leave it.
	 *
	 * @param {object} [options]
	 * @param {string} [options.baseUrl] - where the assets are served from. Required
	 *   anywhere without a filesystem; in Node it can be omitted to use the assets
	 *   in this package. See `docs/ASSETS.md`.
	 * @param {object} [options.toolchain] - a toolchain from `@live-codes/clang-wasm`'s
	 *   `createToolchain()`, for a caller that already holds one. Its lld links what
	 *   this compiler emits, so a page running C/C++ alongside Crystal links with the
	 *   lld it already has instead of fetching a second copy. It stays the caller's:
	 *   `dispose()` never releases it, and the sysroot libraries still come from here.
	 * @param {string[]} [options.compileArgs] - extra `crystal build` flags.
	 * @param {string[]} [options.args] - default program argv.
	 * @param {(fraction: number) => void} [options.onProgress] - asset loading, 0 to 1.
	 * @param {(text: string, what: {source: string, stream: string, stage: string}) => void}
	 *   [options.onLog] - the compiler's and the linker's own output. `source` is
	 *   `crystal` or `wasm-ld`; `stream` is `out` or `err`; `stage` is the stage that
	 *   produced it. A caller that shows the program's output to a user usually wants
	 *   none of this except a compiler warning about their code -- see `run()`'s
	 *   `errors`.
	 * @param {(text: string, stream: 'out'|'err') => void} [options.onOutput] - the
	 *   program's output as it is written, for a caller that wants to show a slow
	 *   program while it runs. The result carries the whole of it either way, and is
	 *   what a caller should draw from when the run ends.
	 * @param {(text: string) => void} [options.onStatus] - what is happening, for a
	 *   status line.
