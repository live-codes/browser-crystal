# The assets

`assets/crystal/` is the payload this package loads: 12 files, ~22 MB gzipped (~68 MB
raw). It is **built, not committed** — `assets/` is gitignored — and pinned by
`src/asset-receipts.js`, which `scripts/write-receipts.mjs` writes from the bytes on
disk. Every read is checked against those receipts, so a stale copy, a truncated
download or a host serving something else is reported rather than compiled.

## What is in it

| file | raw | gzipped | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compiler.wasm.gz` | 35.5 MB | 11.8 MB | the Crystal compiler: `--release`, `--strip-debug`, `wasm-opt -Oz` |
| `lld.wasm.gz` | 21 MB | 7.8 MB | clang-wasm's lld, already gzipped there |
| `stdlib.json.gz` | 6.3 MB | 1.3 MB | the patched standard library, 1369 files as `{ "path": "contents" }` |
| `lib/libc.a.gz` | 2.7 MB | 1.1 MB | wasi-libc |
| `lib/eh/libc++abi.a.gz`, `lib/eh/libunwind.a.gz` | 1.8 MB | 0.48 MB | the wasm exception-handling runtime |
| `lib/libclang_rt.builtins.a.gz` | 0.5 MB | 0.13 MB | compiler builtins |
| `lib/libpcre2-8.a.gz` | 0.4 MB | 0.11 MB | PCRE2, for `Regex` |
| `lib/libwasi-emulated-{signal,mman,getpid,process-clocks}.a.gz` | 0.05 MB | 0.01 MB | what wasi-libc emulates |

The libraries are keyed the way the linker asks for them (`lib/libc.a`), because those
names become paths in the linker's filesystem — see `src/loader.js`.

## Rebuilding

```bash
npm run demo:assets          # from the repository root — Linux or WSL, ~10 minutes
```

`build-assets.sh` needs the WSL build tree (`$OUT=/root/bc-crystal`, with `crystal.wasm`
linked), wasi-sdk 33, PCRE2 built for wasm, clang-wasm's asset cache (for `lld.wasm.gz`),
emsdk's `wasm-opt`, and Python 3. It ends by running `write-receipts.mjs`, which rewrites
`src/asset-receipts.js` — **commit that file**: a receipt is only useful if it is the one
the released package shipped with.

Useful knobs: `OUT`, `WASI_SDK`, `PCRE_LIB`, `CLANG_WASM`, `WASM_OPT`, `NODE`, and `DIR`
(where the script thinks it lives).

To re-pin without rebuilding — for instance after replacing one library by hand — run:

```bash
node scripts/write-receipts.mjs
```

## Why it is shaped this way

Four decisions did most of the work, and they are recorded because each was measured:

- **`wasm-opt -Oz --enable-exception-handling`** takes the linked compiler from 59 MB to
  35.5 MB raw (14.5 → 11.8 MB gzipped). **Never `-all`**: one of those passes emits a
  module V8 rejects with `unknown import kind 0x7e`, which Binaryen's own validator
  accepts — so a variant has to be validated in V8 to be trusted.
- **`-Wl,--strip-debug`** at link time: 79 → 59 MB. The `name` section is kept on purpose,
  because named wasm stack traces are how the compiler is debugged; the *shipped* module
  loses them anyway, to `wasm-opt`.
- **gzip**, inflated by the loader (`DecompressionStream` in a page, `zlib` in Node): no
  server configuration, so any static host works.
- **Nothing that is not needed**: `libc++.a` is absent (a Crystal program has no C++ in
  it), and the standard library ships without `compiler/` — the compiler's own source,
  which a compiled program can never require, and over a third of the standard library's
  bytes.

## What is not here

- **The Windows/Linux build tree** — `build/llvm-wasm/` and `build/crystal-wasm/` in the
  repository, which is where the compiler and this payload come from. The 140 MB of
  libLLVM-for-wasm archives live there too; they are a *build-time* dependency of the
  compiler, not something a page loads.
- **The `browser_wasi_shim` host** — vendored under `../vendor/`, because it is code, not
  an asset.
